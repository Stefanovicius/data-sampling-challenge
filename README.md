# Data Sampling Challenge Solution

This repository contains a solution to the data sampling challenge.

## Design Decisions

### Modification of Class and Variable Naming

While acknowledging that the company may have its own coding style, I followed the best practices I've encountered, which advocate for snake_case variable naming. Additionally, I opted to use the full name for `MeasType`, as it enhances readability and clarity, a common practice across programming languages.

### Rationale for Altering the Proposed Function Signature

- I observed that the example output presented the data as a list, not a dictionary. Hence, I structured the solution accordingly to match the example's format.
- The parameter `startOfSampling` seemed unnecessary as it wasn't explicitly mentioned in the requirements. Consequently, I omitted it, favoring a calculation-based approach derived from the input.

## Additional Notes

It's worth noting that while the solution provided is functional, there may exist more optimized algorithms to tackle this challenge. Future iterations could explore such alternatives for potential enhancements.
